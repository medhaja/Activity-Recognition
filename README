2. Abstract: The dataset collects data from a wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest. Uncalibrated Accelerometer Data are collected from 15 participants performing 7 activities. The dataset is intended for Activity Recognition research purposes. It provides challenges for identification and authentication of people using motion patterns.

3. Relevant Information:
   --- The dataset collects data from a wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest
   --- Sampling frequency of the accelerometer: 52 Hz
   --- Accelerometer Data are Uncalibrated
   --- Number of Participants: 15
   --- Number of Activities: 7
   --- Data Format: CSV

4. Dataset Information
   --- Data are separated by participant
   --- Each file contains the following information
       ---- sequential number, x acceleration, y acceleration, z acceleration, label 
   --- Labels are codified by numbers
       --- 1: Working at Computer
       --- 2: Standing Up, Walking and Going up\down stairs
       --- 3: Standing
       --- 4: Walking
       --- 5: Going Up\Down Stairs
       --- 6: Walking and Talking with Someone
       --- 7: Talking while Standing
       
# My work

1) combine all the csv into one gaint data frame using pandas.
2) See shapa and size. check if the datas are balanced perfectly.
3) if not balance the data.
4) Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
5) Convert the train, test, validation labels into one hot vectors.
6) Define model and compile model.
7) Fit the model with the training data and use validation set and early stopping.
8) Evaluate the model and plot the confusion matrix.

# Future work

1) Use Lstm network as the data might be dependent on previous data.
2) Use Neat algorithm.
3) Use very deep network to get the highest possible accuracy.
4) Use Colab to train the model in cloud.
5)
